Introductory Econometrics For Finance, Chris Brooks
======================================================

In this collection, we implement the applications and examples in the textbook with data provided by the author. These examples will provide a hands-on approach to learning fundamental econometric techniques and models in GAUSS.

.. Note :: We follow the textbook as closely as possible with the aim of demonstrating the concepts in the text. As such, these examples do not always represent the most efficient GAUSS programming.
