Textbook Examples
=================
This project uses hands-on GAUSS examples to demonstrate the statistical and econometric methods found in prominent textbooks.

Our examples emphasize a learn-by-doing approach and include:

*  Explanations
*  Program files
*  Data

.. note:: This project aims to follow the textbook examples as closely as possible and may not always demonstrate the most efficient way to perform computations in GAUSS.

\*This is a work in progress and we recommend checking back often for additions.
