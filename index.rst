Textbook Examples
=================
This collection demonstrates how to implement statistics and econometrics examples from prominent textbooks in GAUSS. It provides explanations, along with the necessary program files and data to reproduce the examples.

The primary goals of this project are to:

*  Reiterate the learning objectives of the textbooks.
*  Demonstrate how to accomplish these objectives using GAUSS.

As such, the implementations in this project may not always demonstrate the most efficient way to perform computations in GAUSS. Where possible, we have highlighted when build in tools can improve efficiency.

This collection is a work in progress and we recommend checking back often for additions.
