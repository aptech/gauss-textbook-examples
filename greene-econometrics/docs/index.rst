Econometric Analysis, William H. Greene
========================================

*Econometric Analysis* by William Greene is one of the most prominent textbooks for graduate level econometrics. The book provides theoretical background accompanied by empirical applications and examples.

In this collection, we implement the applications and examples in the textbook with data provided by the author. These examples will provide a solid background in implementing fundamental econometric techniques and models in GAUSS.

It should be noted that we follow the textbook as closely as possible with the aim of demonstrating the learning objectives in the text. As such, these examples do not always represent the most efficient GAUSS programming.
